            <h1>Masters Research Industry Project (Machine Learning on Capricorn Group Data)</h1>

            <ul>

            <p>During my masters degree I completed a 6 month internship at Capricorn Group, where I had to achieve the following two objective.
                The first objective required the development of a profile of existing credit card customers through exploratory analysis and descriptive analytics. 
                The profile aimed to highlight and report on differences between credit card customers and non-credit card customers. 
                The analysis commenced by first looking at the demographic differences between the average credit card and non-credit card customers. 
                Analysis was also done on customers’ channel usage with respect to online and physical transacting behaviour i.e. how many times a customer transacted at an ATM or average app usage amount. 
                Further profiling was done by making use of clustering to group credit card customers based on their spending behaviour. 
                The clustering was informed by how frequently and at which monetary values these customers transacted. 
                Lastly, clustering was done on transactional data to gain more information regarding the customers’ spending behaviour relative to the type of transaction e.g. restaurants, pharmacies and fuel.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis showed credit card customers own more products,  use their products more frequently and for larger amounts. 
                    This indicates higher leverage within the bank which is supported by lower churn rates among credit card holders. 
                    After the profiling exercise was completed the next objective was to identify customers that aligns to the profiling outcomes.  
                </li>
             <ul> 
            <p>A metric was required to identify potential buyers of credit card products by making use of a data mining approach. 
                A propensity to buy model was developed, indicating the likelihood of a customer to take up a product. 
                The model was developed on a six-month sampling window using credit card ownership as dependent variable. 
                For credit card customers, relevant data six months prior to credit card ownership was used, otherwise using data that included the credit card product influenced many of the variables which skewed the results of the models. 
                The data consisted of demographic, account specifics and channel usage data. 
                Variables were aggregated in various ways and reduced by making use of different statistical variable reduction techniques e.g. variable clustering, weights of evidence (WOE) and variance explained. 
             </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The final model selected was an ensemble model aggregating three different decision tree models. 
                    This model was selected as it best distinguished between credit card holders and non-credit holders and was the model that most accurately identified credit card customers. 
                    The three different decision trees made use of different variables with the most common variables being branch, age of the customer and lastly the income of the customer.
